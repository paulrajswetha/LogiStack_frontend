Avoid functions on indexed columns:\n   -- Slower: WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024\n   -- Better: WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'\n\n4. Use EXISTS instead of IN (for subqueries):\n   SELECT name FROM customers c \n   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id);\n\n5. Avoid unnecessary joins or nested subqueries\n\n6. Use appropriate data types and avoid implicit conversions\n\n7. Analyze execution plans (EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE)",
